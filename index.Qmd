[**R**](https://www.r-project.org/){target="_blank"} is an open-source programming language with a huge library ecosystem that allows you to perform flexible and powerful data analysis. It is extensively used in academic research, but also increasingly adopted in business for data science. [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"} is a popular IDE *(Integrated Development Environment)* which provide tools for coding, visualization, and report generation when using programming in R (and in many other languages!)

## About This Course

This introductory course will prepare you for most future methodological courses in the [*PhD program in Psychological Sciences*](https://dottorato.psy.unipd.it/en){target="_blank"} *(University of Padova)*, where R is extensively used. We will navigate the development environment, work with basic data structures like vectors and dataframes, learn about essential concepts of programming like loops and functions, and see some fundamentals of data visualization. Advanced topics like statistical modelling and data simulation will be covered in future courses and are **not** presented here (though occasional simple examples may appear).

The primary resource for the course is the online book available on GitHub: [***Introduction2R** (English edition)*](https://psicostat.github.io/Introduction2R_EN/){target="_blank"}.

### Getting Started with the Course

1.  **Bookmark the Course Homepage**: Save the URL of the present page [https://enricotoffalini.github.io/Basics-R/](https://enricotoffalini.github.io/Basics-R/){target="_blank"} for quick access to all course materials.
2.  **Install R and RStudio**: go to [**this download page**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"} to install *R* and *RStudio Desktop* on your computer (further setup instructions can be found in [*Chapter 1*](https://psicostat.github.io/Introduction2R_EN/install.html){target="_blank"} of *Introduction2R*)
3.  *Optional* - check your installation by running this code in your newly installed RStudio, and install a few packages:

``` r
pkgs = c("readxl", "psych", "ggplot2")
install.packages(pkgs)
```

### Course Topics

#### Introduction to the R Environment

We will cover the installation of R and introduce how to organize and manage a work session in R Studio, and how to import a dataset.

#### Data Structures and Object Manipulation

We will introduce the main data structures in R and methods for interacting with them effectively. In particular, we will focus on vectors and dataframes.

#### Basics of Programming in R

We will introduce essential programming concepts and their implementation in R, including conditional operations (such as `if...else`), and iterative programming (including the `for` loops and `apply` functions).

#### Data Visualization

*Optional* - only if enough time is left, we will introduce some basics of data visualization. If we do not have time, don't despair: some data visualization will still be presented in future courses in this PhD program.
