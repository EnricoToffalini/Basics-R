[**R**](https://www.r-project.org/){target="_blank"} is an open-source programming language with a huge library ecosystem that allows you to perform flexible and powerful data analysis. It is extensively used in academic research, but also increasingly adopted in business for data science. [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"} is a popular IDE *(Integrated Development Environment)* which provides tools for coding, visualization, and report generation when using programming in R (and in many other languages!)

## About This Course

This introductory course will prepare you for most future methodological courses in the [*PhD program in Psychological Sciences*](https://dottorato.psy.unipd.it/en){target="_blank"} *(University of Padova)*, where R is extensively used. We will explore the development environment, work with basic data structures like vectors, dataframes, matrices, and lists, and learn about essential concepts of programming like conditional statements, loops, and functions. Advanced topics like statistical modelling and data simulation will be covered in future courses and are **not** presented here (though occasional simple examples may appear).

The primary resource for the course is the online book available on GitHub: [***Introduction2R** (English edition)*](https://psicostat.github.io/Introduction2R_EN/){target="_blank"}.

### Getting Started

1.  **Bookmark the Course Homepage**: Save the URL of the present page [https://enricotoffalini.github.io/Basics-R/](https://enricotoffalini.github.io/Basics-R/){target="_blank"} for quick access to all course materials.
2.  **Install R and RStudio**: go to [**this download page**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"} to install *R* and *RStudio Desktop* on your computer (further setup instructions can be found in [*Chapter 1*](https://psicostat.github.io/Introduction2R_EN/install.html){target="_blank"} of *Introduction2R*)
3.  *Optional* - check your installation by running this code in your newly installed RStudio, and install a few packages:

``` r
pkgs = c("readxl", "psych", "ggplot2")
install.packages(pkgs)
```

### Course Topics

##### Introduction to the R Environment and First Steps in R

We will cover the installation of R and see how to organize and manage a work session in R Studio, how to create objects, what are data types, how to perform basic operations on them, and how to import and export data, figures, and workspaces.

##### Data Structures

We will introduce the main data structures in R and methods for interacting with them effectively. We will focus on vectors, dataframes, lists, and more. Dataframes will be given special attention.

##### Basics of Programming in R

We will introduce essential programming concepts and their implementation in R, including conditional operations (such as `if...else`), iterative programming (including the `for` loops and the `apply` family), and defining custom functions.

##### *Advanced*

*For more experienced R users, some materials under the Exercises section will provide more stimulating challenges and instructions, even beyond the scope of the present introductory course.*
