## Like a ~~data scientist~~ data cleaner

*The following set of exercises is a simulation of the challenges you will actually encounter in real life as a data scientist. Know that a large portion of your time as a data scientist will likely be spent on data management and cleaning! In the following scenario, imagine that students (or colleagues) have brought you messy dataframes, full of inconsistencies, varying formats, and other issues. Some guidance is provided here, but your goal is to think critically and figure out the most effective solutions. And don't worry: the real world out there is more nightmarish!*

*Notes:*

-   *Some aspects of data cleaning could be addressed externally (e.g., using MS Excel); however, try to solve all issues within R,* <b>using code</b> instead of manual corrections. Imagine one day you might be working with tens of thousands of rows—manual fixes aren’t feasible!
-   *While brute-force methods may get the job done, aim to write clean, efficient, and concise R code. Solving the problem is the priority, but an optimal solution balances correctness with* <b>minimal code complexity and minimal redundancy</b>.

**SCENARIO:** 

Some students (or colleagues) have provided you with data collected from various scales in a sample of participants (Wechsler, INVALSI \[Italian National Assessment of Students\], Personality Questionnaires). Your task is to perform some computations like a data scientist. However, before this, you will need to fix some inconsistencies, correct possible errors, and merge and combine different dataframes, as the data is scattered across multiple documents.

**DATA:**

-   INVALSI data: Items from the INVALSI tasks, data for some participants are <a href="datasets/ExerData_Invalsi_1.csv" download>here</a>, others are <a href="datasets/ExerData_Invalsi_2.csv" download>here</a>;
-   <a href="datasets/ExerData_Wechsler.xlsx" download>Wechsler data</a>: Scaled scores from the 10 core subtests;
-   <a href="datasets/ExerData_LabTrials.csv" download>Experimental data</a>: Results from an attentional task with multiple trials (in a long form dataset);
-   <a href="datasets/ExerData_Questionnaires.csv" download>Personality data</a>: Scores from two personality scales (Openness, Agreeableness)

**FINAL GOALS:** 

Your task is to create a data science report that includes the following:

-   A correlation matrix (`cor()`) showing the relationships between total scores for these variables: 1. INVALSI; 2. Wechsler; 3. Experimental task; 4. Openness; 5. Agreableness;
-   The descriptive statistics of all the above variables including: mean (`mean()`), standard deviation (`sd()`), median (`median()`), skewness and kurtosis (`skewness()` and `kurtosis()` from the `moments` package); 
-   An analysis to determine if there are any significant differences in mean scores between males and females across these variables, using t-tests (`t.test()`)
-   Some plots such as boxplots (`boxplot()`) and/or histograms (`hist()`) to visualize distributions, and basic scatterplots (`plot()`) to better understand relationships between correlated variables

**HINTS:**
