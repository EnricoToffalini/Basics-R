**Basics of R for Data Science**

This introductory course will prepare you for most future methodological courses in the <a href="https://dottorato.psy.unipd.it/en" target="_blank">*PhD program in Psychological Sciences</a> *(University of Padova)*, where R is extensively used. We will navigate the development environment, work with basic data structures like vectors and dataframes, learn about essential concepts of programming like loops and functions, and see some fundamentals of data visualization. Advanced topics like statistical modelling and data simulation will be covered in future courses and are **not** presented here (though occasional simple examples may appear).

The primary resource for the course is the online book available on GitHub: <a href="https://psicostat.github.io/Introduction2R_EN/" target="_blank">***Introduction2R** (English edition)*</a>.
