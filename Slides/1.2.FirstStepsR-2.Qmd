## Install packages... and more

Most of the data analysis tasks you will perform won’t come from base R: you most often load additional **packages** for specialized functions

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="39%"}
Install a package from CRAN

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("effsize")
```
:::
::: {.column width="61%"}
Simultaneously install multiple packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages( c("effsize","psych","ggplot2") )
```
:::
:::

For development or personal use, you may occasionally install packages from outside CRAN, such as from GitHub: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("FilippoGambarota/filor")
devtools::install_github("EnricoToffalini/toffee")
```

After installing, you need to load the packages using function `library`:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(effsize)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Install packages... and more
### call functions

After loading a package, its functions are directly callable throughout the R session:

```{r}
library(psych)

fisherz(rho=0.5) # use a function from the "psych" package
```

you may directly call any function from any installed package, even without loading it, using "**`::`**"; this is especially useful when there is a risk of functions with conflicting names, or if you just don't want to load an entire package for using a single function: 

```{r}
psych::fisherz(rho=0.5)
```

##

## Reproducibility tip: `sessionInfo()`

When sharing your full R project, also share info on your **R version, OS, and loaded package versions** for reproducibility

```{r,echo=F}
library(lavaan)
library(lme4)
library(semTools)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

## Functions and arguments

Functions typically take some <b>*input*</b> parameters, known as *arguments*, process that, and yield some <b>*output*</b>/result(s)

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="figures/functionsExamples.png"/>
</div>

## Functions and arguments
### arguments

- values or variables you pass to a function as input, or to control its behavior

for example, `seq()` generates a sequence of numbers; "`from`" and "`to`" are arguments: it will provide the integers between these two extremes:
```{r}
seq(from = 3, to = 7)
```

`length.out` controls how many equally spaced numbers must be generated:
```{r}
seq(from = 3, to = 7, length.out = 4)
```

alternatively, `by` defines the step size between numbers:  
```{r}
seq(from = 3, to = 7, by = 0.6)
```

## Functions and arguments
### arguments

- values or variables you pass to a function as input, or to control its behavior

`rnorm()` will generate "`n`" random numbers from a normal distribution with "`mean`" as the average and "`sd`" as the standard deviation:
```{r}
rnorm(n = 5, mean = 100, sd = 15)
```

**Positional matching** - arguments names may be omitted if placed in the correct order
```{r}
rnorm(5, 100, 15)
```


## Functions and arguments

**Default arguments** - a function *might* still work even if some arguments are omitted, if it can use its own *default values* (in this case "`mean=0, sd=1`")
```{r}
rnorm(n = 5)
```

<em>**Errors**</em> - however, omitting mandatory arguments will result in an *Error*
```{r, error=T}
rnorm(mean = 100, sd = 15)
```

<em>**Warnings**</em> - Some inputs may cause the function to produce *Warnings* and bad output, but do **not** stop code execution
```{r, warning=T}
rnorm(n = 5, mean = 100, sd = -15)
```

## Functions and arguments
### *HELP!* see the documentation of a function

There are two ways to access documentation: using "`?`" and using `help()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?rnorm # this will work
help(rnorm) # this does the same
```

## Set up Working Directory

<div style="font-size:40px;">
The **Working Directory** (WD) is the location of the folder in your computer where R reads and saves files by default. 

Let's see my own WD using the `getwd()` function:

```{r}
getwd()
```

If you import/export anything (*data*, *figures*, *workspaces*, etc.) you need to know your WD!
</div>

## Set up Working Directory

As a general rule:

- When you open R or the RStudio app, the default WD may be the `documents` folder (in Windows) or the `home directory` (e.g., `/home/username`; in Linux or macOS);

- This default may be reset at any time from inside RStudio on `Tools > Global Options... > General`;

- If you open a file (e.g., a `.R` script) using RStudio, the WD is set at that file location (unless the RStudio app was already open before);

- However, you can set a new WD at any time from within the R code, using the **`setwd()`** function, for example:
```{r}
setwd( "C:/Users/enric/" )
```

## Set up Working Directory

⚠️ **Windows users**, be careful!

When you copy-and-paste a folder address, Windows will probably take "`\`" as path separator, but "`\`" is the escape character in R, so you incur an error:

```{r, error=TRUE}
setwd( "C:\Users\enric\" )
```

\

### How to fix

```{r, error=TRUE}
setwd( "C:\\Users\\enric\\" )
```

or 

```{r, error=TRUE}
setwd( "C:/Users/enric/" )
```

## Absolute vs Relative paths

- **ABSOLUTE paths**: indicate the full path **from the root**, e.g., `"C:/Users/enric/"` (in Linux it might be `"/home/enric/"`; in macOS `"/Users/enric/"`)


- **RELATIVE paths**: indicate the path starting from *(relative to)* the current directory. Most often, you prefer this for import/export, so the same script works on any device; e.g., `"figures/"` or `../figures/`:
  - `png(filename = "figures/Fig1.png")` saves a file `Fig1.png` into `figures`, which a subfolder **inside** the current WD; 
  - `png(filename = "../figures/Fig1.png")` saves a file `Fig1.png` into `figures`, which is a folder **outside, one level up** (`"../"`) the current WD

## RStudio Projects

<div style="font-size:43px;">
**`.Rproj`** may eliminate the need of using `setwd()` within scripts, so you can use only relative paths
</div>

<div style="font-size:39px;">
- You can create a *new project* in RStudio with `File > New Project...` choose a specific folder

- Keep all materials of your project in the same folder as the newly created `.Rproj` file

- As you open the `.Rproj`, it will automatically start a new *RStudio* session with the WD set into that folder.
</div>

## RStudio Projects

Opening the `.Rproj` file ensures that RStudio automatically sets the project folder as the working directory, so all files are managed relative to here:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="figures/rproj.png" style="width:80%; max-width:700px; height:auto;"/>
</div>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Import/export

<div style="font-size:40px;">
Now let's see how to perform **import/export** operations for:

- **The Workspace**: all objects that exist in your current R session, all results and computations stored so far (see them in the *"Environment" panel* or with `ls()`);

- **Data: SUPER IMPORTANT!** we will focus especially on tabular (Excel-like) data, that we treat as dataframes; 

- **Figures**: save your plots for reports and more in `.pdf`, `.png`, and more formats.
</div>


## Import/export
### Workspace

All your R code (script) is generally stored in text files with a `.R` extension. But where do you save your results and objects?! Maybe you just don't...

However, you can export the entire <em>**workspace**</em> using **`save.image()`**

```{r, eval=F}
# let's populate the workspace first
N = 100
x = rnorm(N,0,1)
y = 2 + 0.6*x + rnorm(N,0,0.8)
df = data.frame(x, y)
fit = lm(y ~ x, data=df)

# now let's save it
save.image("myWS.RData") 
```

<p style="font-size:28px;">*Specifying `"myWS.RData"` is not mandatory but recommended, otherwise your file will simply be named `".RData"`. (By the way... <b>where</b> will it be saved?)*</p>

## Import/export
### Workspace

Alternatively, you can save just one or a few workspace objects using **`save()`**

```{r, eval=F}
# let's populate the workspace first
N = 100
x = rnorm(N,0,1)
y = 2 + 0.6*x + rnorm(N,0,0.8)
df = data.frame(x, y)
fit = lm(y ~ x, data=df)

# now let's save only two objects
save(df, fit, file="myWS.RData") 
```

This will save only objects `df` and `fit` into a newly created file named `myWS.RData`. This is useful when you have an overcrowded workspace and want to save only a few objects containing the final results

## Import/export
### Workspace

Once you open a new R session, you may load the previously stored workspace using the `load()` function, specifying `load("workspace_name.RData")`, like this:

```{r, eval=F}
# empty the workspace to make sure there's actually nothing!
rm(list=ls())

# now load the previously saved workspace
load("myWS.RData") 

# make sure that the objects have been loaded
ls()
```

## Import/export
### Data

<div style="font-size:38px;">
Arguably a **fundamental skill** for anyone working in data science!

Most people use *MS Excel* or similar software (e.g., *LibreOffice Calc*) for handling data, which produce their own file formats (e.g., `.xlsx`). That's perfectly fine. However... the **most versatile data format is `.csv` (comma-separated values)**, a simple text (no formatting, no licences required) file format for storing tabular data/dataframes. 

- **Best practice**: Save data in `.csv` format from your software of choice before importing it in R.
</div>

## Import/export
### Data

Here's an example of using **`read.csv()`** for **importing** data:

```{r}
# IMPORT csv data from a "data" subfolder, and store it in an object named "df"
df = read.csv("data/Performance.csv")

# OR if you want to be explicit on settings:
df = read.csv("data/Performance.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", dec=".")

head(df) # have a look at the first few rows
```

<div style="font-size:22px;">
⚠️ in Italian Excel export settings, it is possible that *separator character* (`sep`) be "`;`" and *decimal point character* be "`,`" so be aware of your settings!
</div>

## Import/export
### Data

If you absolutely want to import your data directly from a **MS Excel** document (`.xlsx`), you may use function **`read_excel()`** from the package `readxl`: 

```{r}
library(readxl)
df = data.frame( read_excel("data/Performance.xlsx") )
# data.frame() forces it to be a dataframe, otherwise it's a tibble
head(df)
```

<div style="font-size:28px;">
- You may even import data from an **SPSS** document (`.sav`) using the `read.spss()` function from the `foreign` package
</div>


## Import/export
### Data

A good trick if you don't want to specify any relative or absolute path, and want to manually select data each time, is using the **`file.choose()`** function:

```{r, eval=F}
df = read.csv( file.choose() )
```

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="figures/selectFileBox.png" style="width: 80%"/>
</div>


## Import/export
### Data

Other "tricks" for importing data involve using the functions in the **RStudio menu**, particularly:

- File > Import Dataset > From text (base)...

- File > Import Dataset > From Excel

- File > Import Dataset > From SPSS...

However ... using these functions is not best practice, because they are specific to the RStudio IDE. **It’s better to use code for reproducibility**


## Import/export
### Data

You have processed data with R, now... how to **export** it? 

When collaborating with someone also using R, you may choose to exchange data directly by exporting the object or the entire workspace as a `.RData` file, using the `save()` or `save.image()` function respectively.

However, if you need to export a dataframe in a more universally readable tabular format, such as `.csv`, you may use **`write.csv()`**:

```{r, eval=F}
# specify the dataframe to export (here named "df")
# along with the desired file name, and other arguments
write.csv(df, file="myExportedData.csv")

# if you don't want row numbering / row names
write.csv(df, file="myExportedData.csv", row.names=F)
```

## Import/export
### Figures

R has a collection of functions for exporting figures in different formats: `pdf()`, `png()`, `jpeg()`, `bmp()`, `tiff()`, `svg()`.

Here is an example using `png()` :

```{r, eval=F}
# set up a graphic output file named "MyFigure.png" with some settings
png("MyFigure.png", height=1500, width=2000, units="px", res=300)

# code for creating a simple boxplot
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width) 

# close the graphic output file and actually export the plot
dev.off()
```
