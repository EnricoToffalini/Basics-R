## Let's see how to

<div style="font-size:40px;">
*Part 1:*

- Create, name objects;

- Use basic operations (arithmetical, relational, logical); 

- Basic types of data; 

*Part 2:* 

- Install, load from CRAN (and more), call functions, help;

- Set up your Working Directory;

- Import, export workspace and data
</div>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Install packages... and more

Traditional installing of a package from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("effsize")
```

installing of multiple packages from CRAN at once:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages( c("effsize","psych","ggplot2") )
```

For development or personal use, you may occasionally install packages from outside CRAN, such as from GitHub: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# examples
devtools::install_github("FilippoGambarota/filor")
devtools::install_github("EnricoToffalini/toffee")
```

After installing, you need to load the packages using function `library`:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(effsize)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Install packages... and more
### call functions

After loading a package, its functions are directly callable throughout the R session:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(psych)

fisherz(rho=0.8) # use a function from the "psych" package
```

Also, you may directly call any function from any installed package, regardless of whether it was or was not previously loaded in the workspace, using "`::`"; this is especially useful when there is a risk of functions with conflicting names, or if you don't want to load an entire package for using just a function: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
psych::fisherz(rho=0.8)
```

## Install packages... and more
### *HELP!* see the "help" of a function

We will explore how functions work, more in detail, later. For now, letâ€™s look at how to access help if something is unclear. Let's take the basic function `mean`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?mean # this will work
help(mean) # this does the same
```

## Set up Working Directory

<div style="font-size:40px;">
The **Working Directory** (WD) is the location of the folder in your computer where R reads and saves files by default. 

If you import/export anything (*data*, *figures*, *workspaces*, etc.) you need to know your WD!

The `getwd()` function allows you to display the location of your current WD. Let's see my own:

```{r}
getwd()
```
</div>

## Set up Working Directory

As a general rule:

- When you open the RStudio app the default WD may be the `documents` folder (in Windows) or the `home directory` (e.g., `/home/username`; in Linux or macOS);

- This default may be reset at any time from inside RStudio on `Tools > Global Options... > General`;

- When RStudio is newly open by opening a file (e.g., a `.R` script file), the WD may be set at that file location *(actually my favorite)*;

- However, you can set a new WD at any time from within the R code, using the `setwd()` function, for example:
```{r}
setwd( "C:/Users/enric/" )
```

## Set up Working Directory

<div style="font-size:46px;">
**RStudio Projects** may eliminate the need of using `setwd()` within scripts.
</div>

<div style="font-size:40px;">
- You can create a *new project* with `File > New Project...` choose a specific folder

- Keep all materials of your project in the same folder as the newly created `.Rproj` file

- As you open the `.Rproj`, it will automatically start a new *RStudio* session with the WD set into that folder.
</div>

## Set up Working Directory

Finally, *not vital for now*, but know the difference between:

- **Absolute path**: `"C:/Users/enric/"` indicates the full directory path from the root

- **Relative paths**: for import/export purposes you may move around the current WD 
  - for example `png(filename="figures/Fig1.png")` may save $Fig1.png$ into the $figures$ directory which is **inside** the current WD; 
  - differently, `png(filename="../figures/Fig1.png")` may save $Fig1.png$ into the $figures$ directory which is **outside, one level up** the current WD

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Import/export
### Workspace

All your R code (script) is generally stored in text files with a `.R` extension. But what about your data?! 

You can save the entire workspace (with all its objects) using the `save.image()` function:

```{r, eval=F}
# let's populate the workspace first
myName = "Enrico"
prof = TRUE
coursesTaught = 4L
age = 36

# now let's save it
save.image("myWS.RData") 
```

Specifying `"myWS.RData"` is not mandatory but recommended, otherwise your file will simply be named `.RData`. (By the way... *where* will it be saved?)

## Import/export
### Workspace

Alternatively, you may even save just one or a few workspace objects, rather than all:

```{r, eval=F}
# let's populate the workspace first
myName = "Enrico"
prof = TRUE
coursesTaught = 4L
age = 36

# now let's save only two objects
save(myName, age, file="myWS.RData") 
```

This will save only variables `myName` and `age` into the newly created `myWS.RData` file

This may be useful when you have an overcrowded workspace and prefer to save only a few objects that store the final results

## Import/export
### Workspace

Once you open a new R session, you may load the previously stored workspace using the `load()` function, specifying `load("workspace_name.RData")`, like this:

```{r, eval=F}
# empty the workspace to make sure there's actually nothing!
rm(list=ls())
ls()

# now load the previously saved workspace
load("myWS.RData") 
# make sure that the objects have been loaded
ls()
```

## Import/export
### Data

<div style="font-size:38px;">
Arguably a **fundamental skill** for anyone working in data science!

Most people use *MS Excel* or similar software (e.g., *LibreOffice Calc*) for handling data, which produce their own file formats (e.g., `.xlsx`). That's perfectly fine. However, the **most versatile data format is `.csv` (comma-separated values)**, a simple text (no formatting, no licences required) file format for storing tabular data/dataframes. 

- **Best practice**: Save data in `.csv` format from your software of choice before importing it in R.
</div>

## Import/export
### Data

Here's an example of using the `read.csv()` function for importing data:

```{r}
# IMPORT csv data from a "data" subfolder, and store it in an object named "df"
df = read.csv("data/Performance.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", dec=".")

head(df) # have a look at the first few rows
```

<div style="font-size:22px;">
Actually, specifying "`header=TRUE, sep=",", dec="."`" is unnecessary and could be omitted because it is the default... but it may be useful to get accustomed with functions arguments; also, in Italian Excel export settings, it is possible that *separator character* (`sep`) be "`;`", and *decimal point character* be "`,`" so... be aware of your settings!
</div>

## Import/export
### Data

If you absolutely want to import your data directly from a **MS Excel** document (`.xlsx`), you may use function `read_excel()` from the package `readxl`: 

```{r}
library(readxl)
# function "data.frame" forces it to be a dataframe, otherwise it's a tibble
df = data.frame( read_excel("data/Performance.xlsx") )
head(df)
```

<div style="font-size:28px;">
- You may even import data from an **SPSS** document (`.sav`) using the `read.spss()` function from the `foreign` package
</div>

## Import/export
### Figures

R has a collection of functions for exporting figures in different formats: `pdf()`, `png()`, `jpeg()`, `bmp()`, `tiff()`, `svg()`.

Here is an example using `png()` :

```{r, eval=F}
# set up a graphic output file named "MyFigure.png" with some settings
png("MyFigure.png", height=1500, width=2000, units="px", res=300)

# code for creating a simple boxplot
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width) 

# close the graphic output file and actually export the plot
dev.off()
```
