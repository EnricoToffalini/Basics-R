## Why becoming an R user?

<div style="font-size:30px;">
- **Free & open-source**: wherever you go, R will be with you at no costs (unlike *SPSS*, *MPLUS*, *MATLAB*, etc.)

- **A real programming language**: difficult at the beginning? but: 1) gives you lots of flexibility; 2) facilitates learning any other programming language (e.g., **Python**).

- **Mainstream in academia** for data science, increasingly used in business. *Job market advantage!*

- **Vast community support** thanks to a large and active community.

- **Huge ecosystem**, >19,000 packages on CRAN, more from other sources (e.g., GitHub), to do amazing stuff including statistical data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, developing webapps [*shiny*], writing reports and even entire books [*bookdown*, *rmarkdown*, *quarto*]).

- Facilitates **reproducible research** by sharing code and workflows.
